Too make this work extract the wheel using

        pip3 install fireControl-0.01-py2.py3-none-any.whl

The config.ini file needs your password and ip address,
The config.ini file goes in the same space as the main.py file

now run the file

python3 main.py -n should test the connection by returning the host name of your router.
                        or maybe
python3 fireControl.py -n should test the connection by returning the host name of your router.

Here are the other command line possibilities.
The most useful being the enable and disable, the intended purpose.

-e or enable      Enable Internet
-d or disable     Disable the internet
-c or configure   Put the router in configuration mode
-u or uptime      Is the router up?
-s or show        Show the firewall rules
-x or exit        Leave the configuration console?
-q or quit        Leave and shut connection
-n or host        Router host name

This program is intended to work with the edge router.

access your edge router from your browser and create a firewall rules to block a specific device
contact me on michael@duplessis.nz to help you set up rules and modify the code if you need to add additional
switches to block say other devices.

I will try and write up a guide to how to do this at some stage but I am quite lazy.
