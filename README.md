# ssh_script
<h1>Fire Control</h1>

Allows one to enable and disable pre configured firewall rules on an edge router with a simple command line tool.
The tool can be installed on any computer on the same network as the router. 

Obviously this is quite a custom piece of software, but can be used to craft, or modify as required. 
The rules are set up in the edge router and tested then they can be disabled.
The ssh_script called firecontrol can be called on very easily to switch the firwall rule on or off.

The script can be run from a cron tool to make configuring more complicated time of use and asl makes it easier to turn the rules off when needed
